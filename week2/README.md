# Week 2 — AI-First Mindset Assignment

This folder contains my work for Week 2 — AI-First Mindset, focused on integrating AI into ShopLite. The assignment identifies AI touchpoints, specifies their design, and estimates costs, while ensuring feasibility, low latency, and minimal integration risk.

## Overview

- Selected two AI capabilities that enhance user experience and reduce friction.
- Applied Week 1 concepts: caching, queues, asynchronous processing, consistency vs. availability.
- Followed Gen-AI best practices: embeddings, grounding, human-in-the-loop, observability, and cost optimization.
- Designed with scalability, latency, and cost-efficiency in mind.

## Next Steps

## Why these two?
We selected **Typeahead / Search Suggestions** and **Support Assistant (RAG + Order Status)** because they directly impact core business KPIs: Typeahead improves conversion by helping users find products faster, while Support Assistant reduces support contact rate and increases satisfaction. Integration risk is low since ShopLite already has the `order-status` API and FAQ markdown. Both can leverage embeddings, caching, and partial denormalization (Week 1 concepts) to achieve p95 latency targets while keeping cost manageable.
